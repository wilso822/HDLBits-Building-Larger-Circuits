# HDLBits-Building-Larger-Circuits
This is my version of HDLBits excercise in building larger circuits starting at https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Exams/review2015_count1k

This is the Mealey Model used for the tim_fsm.v

fancy_timer.v was the fifth and final excercise and was made according to this:
https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Exams/review2015_fancytimer

It used slightly modified versions of shift_count.v, tim_fsm.v, and count_1k.v, then connected all of them to get this unique fancy timer.
